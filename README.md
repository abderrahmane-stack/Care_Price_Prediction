# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for car prices based on historical vehicle data. By analyzing features such as make, model, year, engine specifications, and more, the model aims to provide an estimated price for different cars.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical features, and scales numerical data.
Feature Engineering: Selection and transformation of relevant features to improve model accuracy.
Machine Learning Model: Uses linear regression to predict car prices.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures the performance of the model using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
